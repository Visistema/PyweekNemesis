HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

The Sea of Good and Bad is an action adventure puzzle game. You connect regular
shapes (equilateral triangles, squares and so on) that you find in a random
field of crystals. Then collect these shapes for Mana. Mana is automatically
used to repair your ship, so collect some when you are damaged. Two ships
damage each other when they move within range of each other's cannons.
